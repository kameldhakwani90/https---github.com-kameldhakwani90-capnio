# **App Name**: Capnio.pro

## Core Features:

- Intuitive Navigation Tree: Visual and interactive tree structure for navigation (Sites > Zones > Machines > Sensors) with status badges.
- Simplified Pi Setup: Automated Raspberry Pi (local server) setup process via temporary Wi-Fi and local webpage.
- Automatic Sensor Detection: Automatic sensor detection via Raspberry Pi (Bluetooth/Zigbee/WiFi) with direct assignment to machines/zones.
- Detailed Information Panels: Detailed information panels for Sites, Machines, Sensors, and Raspberry Pi devices, including status, history, and actions.
- Automated Notifications/Alerts: Automated notifications (email/interface) for breached formulas, disconnected sensors, and offline Raspberry Pi devices.
- Simplified User Experience: Streamlined user experience with automatic formula suggestions, real-time monitoring, and no JSON management required for end-users.
- Sensor declaration: Admin interface for declaring and configuring generic sensors (temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.)
- Formula creation: Admin interface for creating dynamic formulas applicable to a range of machines
- Formula validation engine: Admin tool for testing formulas with example sensor data payloads.
- Site and machine registration: User interface to register new machines and physical sites, and associate existing sensors with these machines
- Smart suggestion of formulas: The system suggests compatible formulas based on machine type and connected sensors.
- Real-time Dashboard Monitoring: Dashboard displays machines with breached thresholds.
- Intelligent notifications: Immediate notification delivery (email/app/interface) and logging alerts.

## Style Guidelines:

- Intuitive tree structure for visualizing sites, zones, machines, and sensors.
- Status badges (green, orange, red, white) to indicate the health of each element in the tree.
- Detailed information panels for each element, including key information, status, and actions.
- Real-time data updates and graph displays for sensor readings.
- Clear and concise labels for all elements and actions.
- Alerts and notifications with clear visual cues for critical issues.
- Primary color: Dark blue (#34495E) to convey professionalism and reliability, nodding to the industrial nature of the sensors, but doing so without the color choices becoming tiresome. Dark blues pair nicely with numerous highlight colors.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F3F4) to provide a clean and neutral backdrop, improving readability and focus.
- Accent color: Bright cyan (#2ecc71) to highlight critical alerts and important actions. It conveys activity and dynamism.
- Clean, sans-serif font for the primary text, ensuring readability and a modern look. Example: Open Sans, Lato.
- Simple, geometric icons to represent different sensor types, machine states, and alert levels.
- Consistent spacing and alignment throughout the interface for a structured and orderly appearance.
