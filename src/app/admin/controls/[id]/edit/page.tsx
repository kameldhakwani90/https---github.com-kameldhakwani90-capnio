          This is a radically simplified version of the page to diagnose a
          persistent parsing error.

        <p>
          If you see this message and the app runs without parsing errors,
          the problem was in the JavaScript logic or imports previously present in this file.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the parsing error still occurs with this minimal version, the
          issue is likely external to this file's content (e.g., build cache,
          environment setup, invisible characters, or an issue in AppLayout itself).
